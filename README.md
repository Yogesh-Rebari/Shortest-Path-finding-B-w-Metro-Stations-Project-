# Shortest-Path-finding-B-w-Metro-Stations-Project-
The project demonstrates a practical application of graph theory and algorithms in solving real-world problems. It highlights the importance of efficient data structures (like heaps) in implementing these algorithms. The command-line interface allows users to easily interact with the system and obtain relevant travel information.
